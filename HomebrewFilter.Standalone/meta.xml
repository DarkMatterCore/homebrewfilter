  <long_description>The HomebrewFilter

  Changes in rev41:

//rev41:
- fixed auto-connecting Internet via WiFi
- fixed video initialization problem at PAL 50Hz
- fixed categorizing apps from SD Gecko
- removed remaining references to HBC
- basic support for WifiGecko
  * most messages are shown via WifiGecko. Those that are
    sent prior to network initialization will be missing
  * option to en/disable WifiGecko (settings->network)
  * no option yet to change IP and Port, currently sending
    to 192.168.1.4:4405 (you change your PCs IP from Router
    configuration interface)
- support for SDCardGecko (not SD Gecko!)
  * saves debug messages to SD:/config/HBF/debug.txt
  * endless logging, different logs are split with an
    "HBF Log (YYYY-MM-DD / HH:MM:SS)" message. HBF never
    deletes the logfile on it's own.
Note: ** Gecko priority:
	1. SD Card Gecko
	2. Wifi Gecko
	3. USB Gecko
	if SD Card Gecko is enabled, there's no messages
	send via Wifi or USB and so on. By default HBF
	tries to connect to USB Gecko.
