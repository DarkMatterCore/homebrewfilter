	--=== The HomebrewFilter ===--

== About ==
The HomebrewFilter is an drop-in replacement for the
Homebrew Channel - it allows Homebrew applications to
be loaded and sorted, among other more outstanding
opportunities.

Compared to the Homebrew Channel, the HomebrewFilter
features the following additional functionality:

- boot GameCube Homebrew
- boot into external loaders (Uniiloader, Priiloader)
- load Homebrew from SD, USB, DVD or All
- load Homebrew from FAT, NTFS or EXT2/3/4 formatted devices
- categorize Homebrew (without the need to change directories)
- download additional content directly from within The HomebrewFilter
	* Fonts
	* Translations
	* Themes
- on-the-fly updates via network connectivity
- child-lock mode
- screen adjustment options
- edit meta.xml from within the HomebrewFilter

== Installation ==
Various ways allow to install the HBF

Share-Point: http://www.nanolx.org/hbf/Installer/

a) HBF already installed

aa) HBF <= rev35: download the HBF rev36b manually and put it on your SD-Card
    (sub-folder: apps/) and start it from HBF
ab) HBF >= rev36: just enter the update-dialog (Settings -> Update)

b) HBC already installed

Proceed as in aa)

c) Nothing already installed

follow a guide on how to set-up Homebrew on your Nintendo Wii, for example:

== Compilation ==
Compilation requires devkitPPC and libogc with all portlibs installed.

For more information see: http://www.devkitpro.org

On POSIX systems issueing './distribute' should be enough - if all dependencies
are properly installed - on Non-POSIX systems check the distribute script
in order how to compile properly -- I'm not using any of those OS'
