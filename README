	--=== The HomebrewFilter ===--

== About ==
The HomebrewFilter is an drop-in replacement for the
Homebrew Channel - it allows Homebrew applications to
be loaded and sorted, among other more outstanding
opportunities.

Compared to the Homebrew Channel, the HomebrewFilter
features the following additional functionality:

- boot GameCube Homebrew (device:/gc_apps/)
- boot into external loaders (Uniiloader, Priiloader, Neek2o, BootMii)
- load Homebrew from SD, USB, DVD, SD-Gecko Slot A, SD-Gecko Slot B or All
- load Homebrew from FAT, NTFS or EXT2/3/4 formatted devices
- categorize Homebrew (without the need to change directories)
- download additional content directly from within The HomebrewFilter
	* Fonts
	* Translations
	* Themes
- on-the-fly updates via network connectivity
- child-lock mode
- screen adjustment options
- edit meta.xml from within the HomebrewFilter
- debugging using USB Gecko, WiFi and SD-Card (SD:/config/HBF/debug.txt)
